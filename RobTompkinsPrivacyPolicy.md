PRIVACY POLICY FOR ALEXA SKILLS DEVELOPED BY CHRISTOPHER R. TOMPKINS III
========================================================================
This privacy policy governs your use of the software skills for Amazon Alexa and other similar platforms created by Christopher R. Tompkins III (Skills). Current Skills are the "Where Are My Keys" Skill, and new Skills can be added from time to time:

#### User Provided Information
The Skills obtain the information you provide when you download and register the Skills through the Amazon Alexa skills web site, or any other licenced source. Registration with Christopher R. Tompkins III is not required at this time, although future enhancements may possibly require registration. In this latter case, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of the features offered by the Skills unless you register with us. Credit card information is not collected by any of these Skills at this time. Any information that you share with the online app store during purchase is held by that store and covered by its own privacy policy.

We will not normally use any information you provide to us to contact you. Important information concerning required notices, upgrade and/or bug-fix notifications, or marketing promotions will normally be distributed by means of the Amazon Alexa skills site.

Currently the Skills do not collect login information from and/or for social networking platforms. Any future enhancements which deliver this capability will be notified at the time of delivery or upgrade, and you may consent or opt-out at will.

### Automatically Collected Information
In addition, the Skills may collect certain information automatically as part of normal operation within the context of the Amazon Alexa environment, including, but not limited to, your hardware device unique ID, a unique user ID, your prior usage of the Skills, and information about the way you use the Skills.

These Skills do not collect precise information about the location of your hardware device, though for details of information capture by the underlying platform each relevant terms and conditions agreement should be referenced.

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to Amazon's software environment and services to help us improve the Skills and our service. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

* As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
* When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
* With our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.
* If Christopher R. Tompkins III's development is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.

### Automatic Data Collection and Advertising
We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Skills are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally.

### What are my opt-out rights?
You can stop all collection of information by the Skills easily by disabling the Skills on your Amazon Alexa account. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your device or Amazon account.

Specific Skills or upgraded versions of Skills may have specific opt-out mechanisms. Please contact chtompki@gmail.com to enquire about this.

### Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information
We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Skills and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain Automatically Collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate. If you’d like us to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Skills, please contact us at chtompki@gmail.com and we will respond in a reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the Skills to function properly.

### Children
We do not use the Skills to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. We recommend that if a child is using any of these Skills, this is only done with adult supervision. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at chtompki@gmail.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

### Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Skills. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

### Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and informing you via email, if such email has been volunteered by You at any time. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. You can check the history of this policy below.

### Your Consent
By using the Skills, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing," means using information collected by the Skills or by the computer network faclities provided by Amazon in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States of America. If you reside outside the United States of America your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under the privacy standards of the United States of America.
